POT tokens will be vested through a 3-year period to better ensure the value basis of POT tokens. 

PolkaOracle will seek more solid value basis enforcements such as business development, user growth, community growth and ecosystem construction, etc. 

## A Deflationary Mechanism

Token supply deflation is a mechanism that ensures that the company can generate demand for tokens in the market, and reduce supply at the same time.

Certain proportions of POT tokens will be bought back and burnt using the commission fees during the applications of data feeds by our users. The buy-backs will be carried out on regular basis. 

With demands for data feeds from PolkaOracle increase, there will be more revenue to ensure the sustainable growth of POT values.
